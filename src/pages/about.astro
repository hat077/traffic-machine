	<p>
		The internet is noisy. Trying to find honest data about software salaries, certification value, or tool comparisons often feels like wading through a swamp of marketing fluff and AI-generated filler.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Explainova</strong> was built to be the signal in the noise.
	</p>

	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
	<p>
		We believe that professional decisions—whether choosing a career path, buying software, or hiring a team—should be based on <strong>hard data</strong>, not hype.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our editorial standard is simple:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>No Fluff:</strong> We respect your time. We get straight to the numbers.</li>
			<li><strong>Real Data:</strong> We don't guess salaries; we aggregate them from real job boards and market reports.</li>
			<li><strong>Unbiased Reviews:</strong> If a software tool has a hidden flaw or a paywall, we highlight it.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h2>How We Research</h2>
	<p>
		Our comparisons and guides aren't just opinions. We treat them like engineering problems:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>We Test the Tools:</strong> We don't just read the landing page. We sign up, build workflows, and test the limits of the "Free" tiers.</li>
		<li><strong>We Check the Market:</strong> For career guides, we analyze hundreds of active job postings to see what employers <em>actually</em> require in 2026.</li>
		<li><strong>We Do the Math:</strong> ROI matters. We calculate the break-even points for subscriptions (like Coursera Plus) so you know exactly when it pays off.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
	<p>
		We are currently focused on building the most accurate library of tech career data on the web. We are adding new guides and comparisons weekly.
